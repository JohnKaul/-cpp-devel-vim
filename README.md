# README #

This Vim script _(adopted from `kde-devel-vim`)_ will become a more generic C++ helper script _(not so KDE/Qt specific)_. I want to give full credit to the original authors so I will add a header in the script file with a link to the original. I also don't want to clutter the file with commented out code/lines so I will be deleting them as they become unnecessary or replaced.

### How do I get set up? ###
If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://JohnKaul@bitbucket.org/JohnKaul/cpp-devel-vim.git

Otherwise you can always download this and place the `cpp-devel-vim.vim` file in the `plugin` directory.
