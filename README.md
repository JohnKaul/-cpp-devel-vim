# README #

This Vim script _(adopted from `kde-devel-vim`)_ will become a more generic C++ helper script _(not so KDE/Qt specific)_. I want to give full credit to the original authors so I will add a header in the script file with a link to the original. I also don't want to clutter the file with commented out code/lines so I will be deleting them as they become unnecessary or replaced.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Place this file in your `plugin` directory. It will be sourced for all .cpp, .h files.
